# Mom's Bookshelf
## About the project
**Mom's Bookshelf** is an android/iOs application I made to learn Jetpack Compose multiplatform framework

The aim of the app is not to be functionnal for users but to try the framework and good practises

## Tech
Developed in Kotlin KMM with
- viewModels
- navigation
- room
- material3 with light/dark mode

## TODO
- Book deletion
- Exploring book's genres/authors
- Profile screen : statistics about database
- Book cover fetching

## Maybe later
- Syncronize data in cloud 
- Sharing though some socials networks
- Retrieve book's data from ISBN code (google books api)
- Web version of the project in some techno I don't master yet (probably Spring Boot with kotlin!)
